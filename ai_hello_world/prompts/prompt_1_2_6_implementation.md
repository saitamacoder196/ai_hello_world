# Prompt 1.2.6: Implementation & Verification

## 🎯 Objective
Implement generated Django models, create necessary Django apps, run migrations, update settings, and verify complete functionality of the model layer.

## 🧠 Chain of Thought Process

### Step 1: Django App Creation and Setup
**Reasoning**: Generated models need proper Django app structure. I must create apps, configure settings, and ensure proper project integration.

**Actions to take**:
1. Create Django apps for each model group
2. Update INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
3. Implement generated models in appropriate app files
4. Create necessary __init__.py and apps.py files

### Step 2: Migration Generation and Application
**Reasoning**: Models must be translated to database schema through Django migrations. This process validates model definitions and creates actual database tables.

**Actions to take**:
1. Generate migrations for all new apps
2. Review migration files for accuracy
3. Apply migrations to create database tables
4. Verify database schema matches design specifications

### Step 3: Comprehensive Testing and Verification
**Reasoning**: Implementation must be thoroughly tested to ensure models work correctly, relationships function, and business logic operates as expected.

**Actions to take**:
1. Run Django's model validation checks
2. Test model creation and basic operations
3. Verify cross-app relationships work correctly
4. Test custom methods from DAO specifications
