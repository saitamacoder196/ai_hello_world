You are a senior software engineer. Help me implement an API for idle resource management following the specifications in document "DD".

Requirements:
- Read and follow ALL rules from the DD\MDE-03 document exactly
- Use database structure defined in "DD\database_v0.1.md"
- Follow import templates from "DD\ResourceIdle MNG_Template.csv"
- Write clean, production-ready code
- Include proper error handling
- Add comments explaining key logic
- Follow the project's existing coding standards
- Implement all required endpoints and functions
- Configure Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
- Skip authentication requirements for development testing

Please:
1. First, summarize key requirements from all documents
2. Then provide the complete API implementation with Swagger setup
3. Include example usage and testing scenarios

Make sure every rule and specification is properly implemented.
