You are a senior QA engineer and test automation expert. Help me create comprehensive unit test cases by reading project documentation and generating pytest-based tests.

Requirements:
- Read and analyze ALL project documentation thoroughly
- Generate complete unit test coverage for all functions and classes
- Use pytest framework with proper fixtures and assertions
- Include edge cases, error scenarios, and boundary testing
- Generate detailed test reports with coverage metrics
- Follow testing best practices and naming conventions
- Add clear test descriptions and comments

Please:
1. First, analyze the codebase and identify testable components
2. Create comprehensive test cases with pytest
3. Include test report generation configuration
4. Provide example test execution and coverage reports

Ensure tests are maintainable, reliable, and cover all critical functionality.
